    "This will be a study of the Seeds data set available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). Additional information on this data set and is available here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds. The data set is very similar to Fisher's Iris data set. It is used here as an alternative to Iris, as a simple and straightforward data set that is useful for introducing the main concepts of statistical learning and data science, especially Supervised and Unsupervised Learning and Classficication, Regression, and Clustering.\n",

    "The **target** (also called labels, response, or dependent variable) fall into one of three classes just as in the Iris data set. The $n$, the number of observations (or points or rows), in the data set is very small. Iris contains 150 rows, whereas Seeds contains 210. The $p$, the number of salient **features** (also called predictors, input, or independent variables) is a bit larger than in Iris. Iris has four features, whereas Seeds has seven. In both data sets, all of the features are numerical and continuous."

    "The reader will note that the work in this Case Study has been split across three notebooks. While it is possible to do the work in this Case Study in a single notebook, we will consider it a best practice to use multiple notebooks and to do so to help to structure the work. Each notebook will represent a major phase of the work, while minor phases of work will be designated with subheadings within a specific notebook. This helps with computing resources, especially the execution of JavaScript required to render a Jupyter Notebook, but also with referring to earlier work in later phases of a project."
